# **Imperitive**

Before we begin anything or do any commits at all with sensitive info, add the file with the sensitive information to your .gitignore file. We'll take this out of gitignore when pushing to Heroku. I'll touch up on this later.

# **On Collaborating through GitHub**

the following will show how we can push, pull, merge, etc together with minimal issues: 

So when you're working on your branch, and you want to do a pull request, switch to master branch and do a git pull

* git checkout master
* git pull

this updates your local master so that you can merge your branch with master

* git checkout <your branch>

You want to be on your branch for this next step. For this step, we'll be merging master into your branch.
